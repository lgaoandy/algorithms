- Typically, key value pairs are stored in a fix-sized array
- Utilizes a hashing function that maps a key to the numeric index of its associate value

_Difference from Objects and Maps_

- both are special implementations of the hash table data structure
- Object class adds its own keys
- Keys you input may conflict and overwrite the inherited default properties

_Hashing function_
(3 primary uses)

- store a key-value pair
- get a value given its key
- remove a key-value pair

_Usage_

- implemented for constant time lookup and insertion
- Database indexing
- Caches
