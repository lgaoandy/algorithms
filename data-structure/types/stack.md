_Characteristics_

- sequential collection of elements
- follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO)
- is an abstract data type, defined by its behaviour rather than being a mathematical model

_Props & Methods_

- pop() - removes the most recently added element from the collection
- peek() - get the value of the top element without removing it
- isEmpty() - check if the stack is empty
- size - get the number of elements in the stack
- print() - visualize the elements in the stack

_Usage_

- Browser history tracking
- Undo/redo operations
