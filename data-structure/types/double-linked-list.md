**Double Linked List**

_Characteristics_

- each node has a pointer to both the next node and the previous node
- allows insertion and removal of nodes to be O(1) complexity at the expense of higher space demand

_Key methods_

- Prepend() - adds a new node at the start of the list
- Append() - adds a new node at the ned of the list
- RemoveFromFront() - removes the node at the start of the list
- RemoveFromEnd() - removes the node at the end of the list
- Reverse() - invert the order of nodes in the list
