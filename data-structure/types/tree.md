_Characteristics_

- hierarchical data structure
- consists of nodes connected by edges
- compared to linear data structures, allows quicker and easier access to data
- will not contain any loops or cycles

- Family or organization trees
- Relationship diagrams
- DOM (document object model)
- Chat bots
- Abstract syntax trees

_Terminology_

- Parent & child nodes
- Root node - the first node the tree originates
- Leaf nodes - nodes with no child nodes
- Siblings - nodes with the same parents
- Ancestors - any nodes that branch from the parent nodes
- Path - sequence of nodes and edges from one node to another
- Distance - amount of nodes to reach from one node to another

_Node Properties_

- Degree - the amount of the child nodes a node has
- Depth - the amount of edges from the root to the specific node
- Height - the amount of edges from the deepest leaf from the specific node
