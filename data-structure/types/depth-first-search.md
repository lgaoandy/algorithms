_Depth First Search_

- starts at the root node
- explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- Three types of DFS traversals
     - Preorder
     - Inorder
     - Postorder

_Preorder Traversal_

1. read data of the node
2. visit left subtree
3. visit right subtree

_Inorder Traversal_

1. starts with deepest left subtree
2. backtrack to unread parent
3. visit right subtree
4. backtrack to unread parent
